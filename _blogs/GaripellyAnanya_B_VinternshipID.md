My internship at the VLED Lab, IIT Ropar has been a journey of learning, growth, and self-discovery. I started with curiosity and a lot of questions, unsure of what to expect. Initially, it was hard to keep up with others and learn simultaneously but over time, I learned that this experience wasn’t just about tasks, but about thinking, reflecting, and improving step by step.

One of the most valuable parts was making new connections—learning from peers, mentors, and different perspectives. The Vinternship helped me gain confidence, ask better questions, and take ownership of my learning. I’m grateful for an environment that encouraged exploration and growth beyond technical skills.
